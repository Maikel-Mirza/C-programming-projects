1. Parallel arrays provide us the ability to group related data.  Using what you coded in this workshop, briefly 
explain how you linked related data for any given item in the dataset?  What was the ‘key’ used to accomplish 
this?

I linked related data for a given dataset by placing the arrays inside of a single for loop that iterates for the
same range for all the arrays using the iterator variable i. Additionally, because of this they all have the same
index and start and end in the same place. The priority is the key in this because when we know the priority level 
we can also determine the corresponding finance options and  price.

2. Why do you think it is common practice to iterate arrays initializing the iterator variable to zero and not to a 
value of one?  Justify your answer using an example from this workshop.

I think it is common practice to iterate arrays and initialize the iterator variable to zero because the iterator will be what
continues to store the values to the arrays as it goes through the loop and since index numbering starts at zero, the 
iterator variable needs to be assigned a value of zero.

for (i = 0; i <= numOfItems - 1; i++)
    {            if (cost[i] < minItemCost)
            {
                printf("      ERROR: Cost must be at least $100.00\n");
            }
            else
            {
                continueLooping = 1; // exits the loop
            }
    }
This example demonstrates the for loop being the iterator of the arrays and that the iterator variable i=0 starts at zero 
because this is where the index numbering begins as the first element of the array. Additionally, because zero is the first index
of an array, if you don't initialize the variable to zero it will have garbage values stored there instead.

3. How would you describe conceptually what an array is to a child (5-8-year-old)? How would you describe 
accessing an element in the array? Warning: keep your explanation simple or the child will not understand.

An array is a way of structuring data of a common type(same type of date) together in an ordered way. The data in arrays follow
one after another so there are no gaps between the data. Additionally, to access a single specific element in an array you need to 
reference it at the specific index (place in memory that it is located) like this: identifier[0], which in this case represents
the first element because index numbering begins at zero since it is easier for the computer to understand.
