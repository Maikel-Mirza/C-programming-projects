1. Parallel arrays provide us the ability to group related data. Using what you coded in this 
workshop, briefly explain how you linked related data for any given item in the dataset? What 
was the ‘key’ used to accomplish this?
Parallel arrays are a great method for grouping sections of individual arrays in different iterations which is the parallel aspect of things. These parallel arrays are a great way of storing multiple arrays easily. For workshop for I used double cost, char financeOptions, and int numOfForecast, for my parralel array variables.


2. Why do you think it is common practice to iterate arrays initializing the iterator variable to zero 
and not to a value of one? Justify your answer using an example from this workshop.
It is a good practice to use zero because sometime the iteraton will need to start at 1 and thus iterating from 0 is helpful for situations where you need to start at 0 instead of 1.


3. How would you describe conceptually what an array is to a child (5-8-year-old)? How would you 
describe accessing an element in the array? Warning: keep your explanation simple or the child 
will not understand.
An array is a method for storing and connecting individual pieces of data called elements in a structured format. Arrays an easy way to group and store data, when the data is related to a single variable. 
An element in an array is a single piece of data that is responsible for holding a value.
