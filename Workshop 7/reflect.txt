1. Describe the benefits and advantages of using user-defined types (structures) in this workshop.  You must explain 
your answer using an example from this workshop. 

The benefits of using user-defined types in this workshop were that it allowed me to contain a large set of data in single structures and this made my main 
function simpler. Additonally, using user-defined types beneficial because structures allow for resuability and I was able to use the same structures for both parts
of workshop.
struct PlayerInfo
{
  int lives;                     // number of lives player can have in a game
  char icon;                     // characters symbol for player
  int treasuresFound;            // counter for number of treasures found
  char history[MAX_PATH_LENGTH]; // array for past positions
} player;
This example demonstrates the use of multiple variables inside a structure. Additionally, the advantage of a structure is that
you can change the variable information from within the structure instead of inside main, which is great for resuability.


2. If we enhanced this workshop to keep a history of games played including the endgame results, briefly describe 
what two major logical changes you would have to make to your program to make this possible? 

First I would add a variable to the game structure like game.history[MAX_PATH_LENGTH] for the history of games played.
Secondly, I would add arrays for keep history of games played and endgame results in the same way as I did with the history array
in my program.



3. What part of this workshop did you spend the most time working on?  What did you do to overcome your 
difficulties? 

I spent the majority of my time on this workshop with understanding and implementing the board options that you need to print
like $ or ! if its a treasure or a bomb. This was something I hard time figuring out how to implement and it cost me a lot of time trying different
things to see what would work. To overcome my difficulties it required me trying to understand loops better and how I could utilize them so that
I could generate the right values to print. Overcoming this also required some trial and error.
